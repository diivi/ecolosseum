    <h2>Social Distancing</h2>
    <p>
      Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household. <br> <br>
      To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.<br> <br>
      Keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread in communities.
      <br> <br>
      Concluding from the results of the simulation on the left, the number of people doing outdoor activites is directly proportional to the speed and spread of coronavirus.
